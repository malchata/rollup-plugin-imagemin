## Contributing

`rollup-plugin-imagemin` should serve admirably for your purposes, but as we're all aware, bugs can crop up in unexpected places. If you find anything wrong, please file an issue (after first looking at [the list of existing issues](https://github.com/malchata/rollup-plugin-imagemin/issues), of course) and include the following:

- A stack trace of the error you're receiving (if you're receiving one).
- Your OS version.
- Your Node version.

If you want to propose a new feature, please file an issue first and let's chat! While I admire the enthusiasm of unsolicited pull requests, it's good to talk about new features and weigh the pros and cons before flying headlong into writing code for them.

On the other hand, if you've discovered a bug and have a fix, feel free to submit a pull request detailing the problem you encountered, and how your code contribution fixes it!
